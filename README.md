# Taskboard

A simple task tracking web app built with Flask. Made this to practice Flask routing and templates — nothing fancy, just a way to keep track of things you need to do.

## What it does

- Add tasks with a title and optional description
- View individual task details
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks

## Getting started

You'll need Python 3.8+ installed.

1. Clone the repo

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   **Mac/Linux:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   **Windows:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:
```
deactivate
```
